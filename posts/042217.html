          Welcome to my blog. My name is Andrew Oldham. (If you haven't figured that out yet I am surprised you made it to this post) For the next 15 weeks, I will be providing you with my inner thoughts, my experiences, and hopefully a lot of witty sarcasm as I make my journey through coding bootcamp at The Flatiron School in NYC. From there on to a new job and a bright future and lots more witty sarcasm.

          So now that I have made my introduction, how about a little background? I grew up on Long Island, NY in a town called Islip Terrace. I got married almost a year ago to my loving wife Kaitlyn. We are currently renting an apartment from her parents in Kings Park. (Also part of Long Island) I went to DeSales University in Center Valley, PA for four years studying math and chemistry. After four years of lots of fun and learning and some great new friends, I failed to graduate and was stuck in a decent pile of debt. A couple of odd jobs later and I ended up driving a mini bus for Acme Bus Corp for the next five and a half years. I love driving and I am inevitably smarter than most kids and a good majority of teenagers (This means I could usually handle all of their shenanigans). To say I enjoyed waking up every day and loved every minute I was working would definitely be an extremely inaccurate statement (I wouldn't be writing this blog if I did, now would I?), but I could tolerate it and it paid very well for someone without a degree.

          This brings us to the main event! Shortly after New Years, I noticed an advertisement on my phone for something called AppAcademy. It had a short message to it, "Come learn coding over 12 weeks, make an average of $105,000 a year after graduation, and you can do this even if you had never coded before." Needless to say, I was a bit intrigued and planned to do some research when I got home that day. Turns out there are a lot of these "coding bootcamps" that have been springing up over the past few years. Some of them are only online courses, others like AppAcademy only have in-person courses, and of course still others, like The Flatiron School, have both. At first, I was like "Oh cool, AppAcademy has a prep course that you can take to guarantee admittance!", but through a little digging and some patience, I found out that it does indeed guarantee admittance (to one of nine schools). What I also found out was the $105,000 expected average for the first year of work was for the San Francisco based campus and also probably exaggerated a bit. At this time I starting looking at the other eight schools on the list of "guarantees" to see what and how they offered their courses to see if one school stood out among the rest. What a surprise one of them did! I bet you can guess which one. Yup, that's right, The Flatiron School. Initially, it was just the fact that they offered a free trial course (javascript or ruby). Then they released their "First Online Jobs Report", which you can find <a href="http://outcomes.flatironschool.com/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=41697719&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KrbkCkpOzE8nT5qnUVurEWzDC82MUCqp5Jf5qm-KIT0dPoFjqqM_ZtUeQjGzAfsgWZybgjI7hLT5IDBonwwuqz6nszA8CYy66dKFUfg6Ay9iMTDQ&_hsmi=41697719" target="_blank">here</a>, that goes into detail on what their alumni for the past couple of years did in their first year (averages of course). My interest in attending quickly grew. Further still, they then released a full prep course, similar to AppAcademy's I am assuming, where you got javascript and the ruby trial course in addition to a sample of the career prep materials their soon to be graduates get.......all for free. Now I am definitely hooked. It just came down to a when and a do we have enough to survive while I don't work.

          Working through the prep course work was exciting, frustrating, and sometimes downright confusing. There were definitely moments of doubt, but with a little patience and some cajoling from my wife I hacked and slashed my way through the labs and lessons, was able to more quickly work through the error logs that appeared when I did not code something exactly right, and slowly grew more confident in my coding abilities. After a couple of said hacking and slashing moments and a whole bunch of procrastination, my wife and I sat down to tackle the biggest questions, 1) Was this the right move for me?, and 2) Could we afford it in our current conditions? As most of you probably know, questions like these are usually not tackled quickly, but we both quickly agreed that this was definitely the right move for me. And so I applied. It was late that night, but I said to myself if I don't do this now I am going to continue to find excuses. A couple of hours later I had submitted my application and could not believe how good it felt to at least be attempting to move my life forward. Quite surprisingly I received an email for the first interview the following day, which I promptly scheduled for that Thursday. This interview was the personal interview and went as smoothly as I could have hoped for. Within half an hour I had received another email saying I had impressed them and I could sign up for a technical interview as soon as I had the technical assessment completed. Turned out the entire assessment was stuff I had already done while completing the prep course, so I quickly signed up for the first available interview the following Thursday. The technical interview consisted of going over the code I had made for one of the labs, the last one of the prep work, that I had not looked at in a few weeks. Not knowing what to expect from this interview I was a bit nervous and made a few mistakes throughout the interview, but it felt as if this was what they were trying to get us to do. Make us break and fix our code so that they could watch us work through the process problem solving for the errors that resulted. I spent the whole next day trying not to check my phone every 13.5 seconds to see if I had gotten a new email from Flatiron while constantly telling myself if they don't respond today that it would be ok and that I could wait until Monday. 12 o'clock no email, 1 o'clock no email, 4 o'clock..(trying not to be depressed)..no email. So I finished up my run for the day and then headed home expecting to be tortured all weekend long from not having received a response. Having accepted defeat I figured since it was now after 6 pm (the time when it couldn't be possible for anyone from the admissions team to still be at work) I would check my email one last time to be sure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxCMPQzqvk" target="_blank">(Cue scene from The Mask)</a> I. HAD. AN. EMAIL!!!! AND IT WAS FROM FLATIRON! Nervously I opened the email (after nearly having my phone slip out of my finger 6 or 7 times) and read one word...Congratulations. I, literally, jumped so much and so high that I nearly smashed my head through our drop ceiling (please note our drop ceiling is only 7'4", yup I just measured, and I am 5'10"). Yea I was really that excited. I quickly threw my shoes back on to head over to my wife's office, she almost broke my ribs from the hug she gave me.

          Ok, yay I made it in, now what? Thus begins the month long planning of how to make sure we survive this whole process. Shortly after I received the good news I left my job as a bus driver. With Easter around the corner, the approximately 100 hours of prework to complete, and the organizing of funds for transportation and all the other monthly expenses, I decided it would be smart to give myself a few weeks to focus. To my surprise, I was able to complete the necessary prework much quicker than I anticipated, so when my father-in-law presented me with an opportunity to work for a week and a half for about 3 times as much as I had been making in that time frame it was impossible to pass up. So for ten days, I spent numerous hours working in Kansas City, MO helping my father-in-law and one of his colleagues build and install containment structures for local customer data huts. Long story short, it was long and grueling work that left me on the brink of true exhaustion the last day on the job. I am talking extreme fatigue, hot and cold flashes, and a massive migraine that caused this past week before class to be not so pleasant or relaxing. And now with a day left before class, I am beyond excited, terrified of all the new experiences I will need to have just to get to class on time the first day, and anxious to get this whole new life started.
